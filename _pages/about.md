I am a second year Ph.D student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at ***The Ohio State University***. I am a member of [Computer Architecture Research Lab](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~teodorescu.1/arch/index.html) lead by **Radu Teodorescu**. My research spans over Computer Architecture, Hardware Security and Trusted Execution Environments. Currently, I am more focused pre-silicon validation of hardware designs using fuzzing techniques.
