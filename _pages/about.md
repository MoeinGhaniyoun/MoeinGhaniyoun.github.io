I am a second year Ph.D student at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University. I am a member of Computer Architecture Research Lab lead by Radu Teodorescu. My research spans over Computer Architecture, Hardware Security and Trusted Execution Environments. Currently, I am more focused pre-silicon validation of hardware designs using fuzzing techniques.
